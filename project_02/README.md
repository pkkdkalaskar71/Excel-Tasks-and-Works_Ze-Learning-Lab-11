# Cofee_sale Analysis
In this project, I used Excel to analyze coffee shop sales data, focusing on data cleaning with Power Query, data modeling with Power Pivot, and visualizing insights with charts. The key questions addressed are:
1-How do sales vary by day of the week and hours of the day?
2-Are there any peak times for sales activity?
3-What is the total sales revenue for each month?
4-How do sales vary across different store locations?
5-What is the average price/order per person?
